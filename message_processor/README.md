### Message Processor (Headless)

Please see the main README of the repo for how to use the message processor.

The message processor is, more or less, a single class called
*VoteMonitor* that listens in a loop for incoming messages and which
posts corresponding votes to the API server.

There is also a test-driver class, for the purpose of
smoke-testing.
